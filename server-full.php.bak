	<h2>Big Announcement!</h2>
	<p>WinsVideo right now is having more and more video uploaded to the site. 
	<br>Which is a very good start for our website. But, right now our server is almost full or space. 
	<br>with 80 GB of storage. So, if users upload many videos at the same time, the server would be full in no-time.</p>
