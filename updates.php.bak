    <h3>Update, Thursday the 19th of September 2019</h3>
    <br>1. New Realtime Stats
        <br>Here's what you have been waiting for, we made a new realtime stats page. 
        <br>that updates 2 seconds a time, with larger fons and tables. In the future we are 
        <br>maybe deleting the borders. If you want to use it, please go to 
        <br><a href="realtime.php">Here. realtime.php</a> <br>

    <h3>Update Saturday, the 14th of September 2019</h3>
    <br>1. Realtime Stats
        <br>We are making the realtime stats update more faster. From 1 Second to 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds
        <br>And for the fonts and table style we also update it! So, it will be more modern. 
        <br>We are trying to make the realtime stats more modern and there will be another version 
        <br>which will be updated 2 second at a time. 

        <br><br>
       

    <h3>Update Sunday, the 8th of September 2019</h3>
    <p>1. User Access
        <br>We updated how the website will be shown up when the user enters "winsvideo.net" in the search tab. 
        <br>By bringing back the "Redirect" Feature to WinsVideo.
        
    <br>2. Login System
        <br>We found out that WinsVideo has a problem when signing in to the site. 
        <br>When the users enter the site and sign in. After clicking the sign in button, the user is still not signed in. 
        <br>So, that's why we need to bring back the redirect feature, because the "iframe" tag is not supported in this feature. 

    <br>3. About Section 
        <br>We add some text to the about sectio. Includes the introducing part above the detail section. 
        <br>

    <br>4. Deletion of ID's in the realtime stats. 
        <br>We think that the ID's are not useful in this particular way. So, we are deleting it from the page. 

    <br>End of the updates for Sunday. 
                    <p>
